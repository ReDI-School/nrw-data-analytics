# Data Analytics coure in ReDI School NRW

## What you learn
- Pandas and Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Learning process
- Lecture -> Project -> Review
- Each lesson takes place with one presenting teacher and one support teacher

## How do we conduct projects?
- Students work either with the Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or the [JuperLab](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo-eoawtdbj/lab/tree/demo)
- One project per week (we have 9 modules for 24 lessons)
- Two students per project, switching weekly, organise it on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19BwCGNIUWks-qOdsjNDo9BIoddVXo0Ps/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104114812937905751764&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Teachers support students to conduct projects
- Set of questions

## Peer review
### Why reviewing?
- We at the ReDI School students learn together and thrive together
- Peer review is about giving feedback
- Peer review is about understanding your peers’ code

### How to review
Keep in mind:
- Be positive: We are here to learn and to thrive together
- Peer review has take place while both groups are present
- Give constructive feedback

### Check if your team is ready for review
- Go into the breakout room of the team
- Team shares their screen and explains code and conclusions
- Fill out the review section
- Give them feedback on their code and conclusions.
