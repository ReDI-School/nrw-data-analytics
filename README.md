# Data Analytics coure in ReDI School NRW

## What you learn
- Pandas and Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Learning process
- Lecture -> Project -> Review
- Each lesson takes place with one presenting teacher and one support teacher

## How do we conduct projects?
- One project per week (we have 9 modules for 24 lessons)
- Two students per project, switching weekly
- Teachers support students to conduct projects
- Set of questions

## Peer review
### Why reviewing?
- We at the ReDI School students learn together and thrive together
- Peer review is about giving feedback
- Peer review is about understanding your peers’ code

### How to review
Keep in mind:
- Be positive: We are here to learn and to thrive together
- Peer review has take place while both groups are present
- Give constructive feedback

### Check if your team is ready for review
- Go into the breakout room of the team
- Team shares their screen and explains code and conclusions
- Fill out the review section
- Give them feedback on their code and conclusions.

## Curriculum outline
### Pandas and Data Analysis

For projects:
1. Copy the colab and paste your link into the spreadsheet for your team
2. Mark it as ready for review once you are done with it
