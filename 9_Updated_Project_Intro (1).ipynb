Sincce the spring of 2017, China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has seen a drastic rise in the mass incarcerations of its ethnic minority citizens – most notably, the Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Hui – with hundreds of thousands being locked up in detention centers. \n","\n","- you can download different data sets (deaths, camps...)

What kind of information does the survey contain?\n","2.   Which variables are particularly interesting to you and why? \n","3. Analyze the salary and how different variables are correlating with it.\n","\n","**Prisoners & Detention Centers**\n","1.

Investigate blood levels of HbA1c which is a blood biomarker of blood sugar levels and therefore an indicator of diabetes\n","2.
