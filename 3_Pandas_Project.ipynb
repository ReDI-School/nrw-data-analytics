[Immobilienscout 24](https://https://www.immobilienscout24.de/). It the biggest platform for renting appartments in Germany. The company hires data analysts and data scientists for analyzing the market data. They are especially interested in the Berlin market. The company wants to understand where to publish advertisment.\n","\n","--- \n","## The dataset:\n","The datasets contains information about rental appartments in Berlin. \n","One row is for one appartment. The dataset contains 6 columns.  \n","- Region: is the Berlin district, where the flat is located\n","- Condition: is the condition of the flat\n","- Rooms: The number of rooms the flat has\n","- Rent: Monthly rent for the flat\n","- Year_Construction: The year in which the house was build\n","- Space: How many square meters does the flat has?\n","\n","---\n","## The Task:\n","### Part 1\n","1. How many apartments are there in Mitte in a 'well-kept' condition?\n","2. How many apartments are there in Kreuzberg built before 1900?\n","3. What are the average spaces of the apartments having 4 rooms?\n","4. Which is the most expensive region on average and what is the maximum rent for this region?\n","\n","Bonus:\n","5. What are the min, max and average number of rooms of the apartments in Köpenick?\n","\n","---\n","### Part 2\n","6.  What is the average price per square meter for different Regions?\n","7. Is there a difference of average room space (`Space` divided by `Rooms`) for apartments built after 2000 versus apartment built before 2000?\n","8. What's the percentage of the apartments in high quality condition? \n","In order to answer this question let's assume that high quality conditions are: `first_time_use`, `mint_condition`, `refurbished`, `first_time_use_after_refurbishment` and `fully_renovated`. The rest we can categorize as low quality condition.\n","Bonus:\n","9. We added to the dataset 2 new columns: `Posted_date` and `Rented_date`. As Immobilienscout we are interested in 2 KPIs:\n","  \n","  a) How many apartments where posted each month? \n","  \n","  b) How many day does it take from posting about the apartment and renting it? We are interested in how this number change depending on the month of the posting.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RJACfmzHOonL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"4PNN-LiMSMAZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["immo = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliandnl/redi_ss20/master/berlin_rental.csv\")\n","print(immo.sample(5))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9-ca52xaOCMb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663702668862,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":439,"user":{"displayName":"Ka Ba","userId":"08277395367003334094"}},"outputId":"b0391758-dc6a-4a63-8bea-1e0e0e8f7258"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["          Region       Condition  Rooms    Rent  Year_Construction   Space\n","358  Wilmersdorf  first_time_use    3.0  1700.0               2017   82.07\n","350   Tiergarten  first_time_use    3.0  2375.0               2019  100.00\n","129   Tiergarten  no_information    1.0  1038.0               2020   30.00\n","512     Köpenick      modernized    2.0   750.0               1997   62.00\n","5       Köpenick       well_kept    2.0   840.0               1997   73.51\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["immo.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4W7pcxA4S06h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663700789233,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":427,"user":{"displayName":"Ka Ba","userId":"08277395367003334094"}},"outputId":"f1b221aa-992f-452d-ba84-fc9e7030071b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 764 entries, 0 to 763\n","Data columns (total 6 columns):\n"," #   Column             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------             --------------  -----  \n"," 0   Region             764 non-null    object \n"," 1   Condition          764 non-null    object \n"," 2   Rooms              764 non-null    float64\n"," 3   Rent               764 non-null    float64\n"," 4   Year_Construction  764 non-null    int64  \n"," 5   Space              764 non-null    float64\n","dtypes: float64(3), int64(1), object(2)\n","memory usage: 35.9+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k2Gv9pEiU4Ao"},"source":["# 1.How many apartments are there in Mitte in a 'well-kept' condition?"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# your code here"],"metadata":{"id":"tX73rkaF3P8n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FrujnQH60Wt3"},"source":["# 2.How many apartments are there in Kreuzberg built before 1900?"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# your code here"],"metadata":{"id":"Xts2v4Nh3PjT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KwB1lNjx0YdA"},"source":["# 3.What is the average space of the apartments & number of rooms per region?"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# your code here"],"metadata":{"id":"Jqne-5gt3Oik"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pWtdIHKbqq7R"},"source":["# 4.Which is the most expensive region on average and what is the maximum rent for this region?"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# your code here"],"metadata":{"id":"DIwOJY6o3Nuw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tcXNCkyBCSuH"},"source":["# Bonus Question:\n","5.
