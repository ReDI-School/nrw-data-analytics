        "Welcome to your first project! Have you heard about Immobilienscout 24?  [Immobilienscout 24](https://https://www.immobilienscout24.de/). It the biggest platform for renting appartments in Germany. The company hires data analysts and data scientists for analyzing the market data. They are especially interested in the Berlin market. The company wants to understand where to publish advertisment.\n",
        "\n",
        "--- \n",
        "## The dataset:\n",
        "The datasets contains information about rental appartments in Berlin. \n",
        "One row is for one appartment. The dataset contains 6 columns.  \n",
        "- Region: is the Berlin district, where the flat is located\n",
        "- Condition: is the condition of the flat\n",
        "- Rooms: The number of rooms the flat has\n",
        "- Rent: Monthly rent for the flat\n",
        "- Year_Construction: The year in which the house was build\n",
        "- Space: How many square meters does the flat has?\n",
        "\n",
        "--- \n",
        "## The Tasks:\n",
        "1. What is the average price per square meter for different Regions?\n",
        "2. Is there a difference of average room space (`Space` divided by `Rooms`) for apartments built after 2000 versus apartment built before 2000?\n",
        "3. What's the percentage of the apartments in high quality condition? \n",
        "In order to answer this question let's assume that high quality conditions are: `first_time_use`, `mint_condition`, `refurbished`, `first_time_use_after_refurbishment` and `fully_renovated`. The rest we can categorize as low quality condition.\n",

        "B) How many day does it take from posting about the apartment and renting it? We are interested in how this number change depending on the month of the posting.\n",
