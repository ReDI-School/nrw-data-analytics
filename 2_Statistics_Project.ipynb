Have you heard about Ronald Aymer Fisher? He is the founder of the modern frequentist statistics and experiment randomization. This is the type of statistics that is still used today e.g for the market authorization of drugs and vaccines. Although Fisher roots his work in very analytical methods, he is probably also one of the most controversial figure of science and polymath in the 20th century from today's point of view, especially when it comes to his work as a geneticist.\n","\n","--- \n","## The dataset:\n","Implicit and variable depending on the way the project is approached. \n","\n","--- \n","## The Task:\n","1.
