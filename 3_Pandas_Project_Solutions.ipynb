[Immobilienscout 24](https://https://www.immobilienscout24.de/). It the biggest platform for renting appartments in Germany. The company hires data analysts and data scientists for analyzing the market data. They are especially interested in the Berlin market. The company wants to understand where to publish advertisment.\n","\n","--- \n","## The dataset:\n","The datasets contains information about rental appartments in Berlin. \n","One row is for one appartment. The dataset contains 6 columns.  \n","- Region: is the Berlin district, where the flat is located\n","- Condition: is the condition of the flat\n","- Rooms: The number of rooms the flat has\n","- Rent: Monthly rent for the flat\n","- Year_Construction: The year in which the house was build\n","- Space: How many square meters does the flat has?\n","\n","---\n","## The Task:\n","### Part 1\n","1. How many apartments are there in Mitte in a 'well-kept' condition?\n","2. How many apartments are there in Kreuzberg built before 1900?\n","3. What are the average spaces of the apartments having 4 rooms?\n","4. Which is the most expensive region on average and what is the maximum rent for this region?\n","\n","Bonus:\n","5. What are the min, max and average number of rooms of the apartments in Köpenick?\n","\n","---\n","### Part 2\n","6.  What is the average price per square meter for different Regions?\n","7. Is there a difference of average room space (`Space` divided by `Rooms`) for apartments built after 2000 versus apartment built before 2000?\n","8. What's the percentage of the apartments in high quality condition? \n","In order to answer this question let's assume that high quality conditions are: `first_time_use`, `mint_condition`, `refurbished`, `first_time_use_after_refurbishment` and `fully_renovated`. The rest we can categorize as low quality condition.\n","Bonus:\n","9. We added to the dataset 2 new columns: `Posted_date` and `Rented_date`. As Immobilienscout we are interested in 2 KPIs:\n","  \n","  a) How many apartments where posted each month? \n","  \n","  b) How many day does it take from posting about the apartment and renting it? We are interested in how this number change depending on the month of the posting.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RJACfmzHOonL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as
